## Overview

LazyBones is an personal knowledge agent designed for people overwhelmed by information.  
Whether you're scrolling through Facebook, Instagram, X, or reading a news site during work, you often see posts you *want* to understand but **don’t have time to read**.

With a single click on the LazyBones browser or mobile extension button, the system captures the page content, generates a concise summary, extracts key points, performs background research, and delivers a complete understanding report—ready to read anytime.

LazyBones turns fleeting content into structured, long-term knowledge.
